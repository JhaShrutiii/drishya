## WORKING

In our proposed system there are different features like voice assistant, obstacle detection and face recognition. 
The camera is placed at the centre of the glasses.
The Ultasonic sensors are attached to the glass to detect the obstacles.
The earphones are placed on the glasses so that the user receives the output.
 
 When button 1 is pressed the obstacle detection starts and the ultasonic sensors attached to the glass to detect the obstacles and inform the user about the same.
 
When  utton 2 us pressed the voive recognition starts and when the user asks the assistant a question such as "time" or "date" etc the user is given the output. The user can also search for some information or news using voice assistant and also make emergency calls

When Button 3 is pressed The camera provides real time data of the people in his surroundings and depending upon the dataset it recognizes the known faces and unknown faces are given an output as unknown faces.
